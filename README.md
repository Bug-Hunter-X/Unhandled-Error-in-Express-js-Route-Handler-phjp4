This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: the lack of proper error handling. The `bug.js` file shows the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version.  The bug arises from attempting to parse a user ID as an integer without validating its format.  The solution adds input validation and comprehensive error handling to prevent unexpected behavior.
